1. Grab the associated release text from [twilio/guardrail/releases](https://github.com/twilio/guardrail/releases)

2. Create a release tag: [link](https://github.com/twilio/sbt-guardrail/releases)

3. Once the tag is created, travis-ci will start building a release immediately.
   Artifacts should be published to bintray and sonatype automatically.
